# Pokémon Memory Game

A fun little Pokémon game where the user has to find the pairs of Pokémon. I built it following Tania Rascia's tutorial for building a memory game using plain JavaScript.

You can find the demo, source and tutorial [here](https://www.taniarascia.com/how-to-create-a-memory-game-super-mario-with-plain-javascript/).

# Motivation

I wanted to gain more experience with JavaScript and this game gave the opportunity to do so while building ssomething fun and engaging.

# Build status

I'm currently working on adding more features to the game, such as a moves counter and a timer. Since this was my first time working with JavaScript, adding aditional features has been challenging, but a good way to make sure my code was well-structure and organized.
